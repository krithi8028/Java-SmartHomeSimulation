# Java-SmartHomeSimulation

Smart home simulation, at the forefront of the connected living revolution, allows us to envision, test, and innovate within the smart home ecosystem.
Connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), smart homes enhance convenience and sustainability, using technology to control and automate devices, appliances, and systems.

## SmartDevice Interface

The SmartDevice interface establishes a core contract in smart home automation with two essential methods: turnOn() and turnOff(). This enforces uniform behavior, allowing for easy management and integration of various smart devices while promoting code consistency and extensibility in the system.

## Understanding the "Device" Abstract Class

The "Device" abstract class, which implements the "Smart Device" interface, plays a fundamental role in creating smart devices with shared functionality. Within this class, it maintains a private Boolean variable, "isOn," to represent the on/off state of the device. To control this state, it offers two methods: "turnOn" and "turnOff," which not only change the device's status but also provide feedback by displaying a relevant message. Additionally, the class provides an "isOn" method to ascertain the current state of the device. Its design allows for seamless extension and customization for various smart devices while ensuring a consistent interface for turning on and off, along with the ability to report the device's current status.

## "Light" Class: Extending the Device

The "Light" class is a subclass of "Device," inheriting its core features for managing the on/off state. In addition, "Light" introduces functionality specific to lighting. It has a private "brightness" variable, allowing control of the light's intensity. The "setBrightness" method changes the brightness level and prints a corresponding message, while "getBrightness" retrieves the current brightness setting. This class enables the creation of smart lights with the ability to adjust their brightness, building upon the common device management provided by its parent class "Device."


## "Thermostat" Class: Extending the Device

The "Thermostat" class, a subclass of "Device," inherits the basic on/off functionality while introducing specific features for temperature control. It includes a private "temperature" variable, allowing users to set and monitor the desired temperature. The "setTemperature" method facilitates adjustments and provides a temperature change message, and "getTemperature" retrieves the current temperature setting. This class empowers the creation of smart thermostats, building upon the foundational device management capabilities offered by its parent class "Device."


## "CloneableDevice" Interface: Enabling Device Cloning
The "CloneableDevice" interface is designed to enable the cloning of smart devices that implement the "SmartDevice" interface. By extending the "Cloneable" interface and specifying a generic type "T" that extends "SmartDevice," it enforces a standard method called "cloneDevice." This method allows creating copies of smart devices, ensuring compatibility with device-specific features. This interface is a crucial building block for creating replicable instances of smart devices and enhancing the flexibility of device management and integration.

## ClonableLight (Concrete Class for Clonable Light):
ClonableLight is a specialized class that represents a smart light device capable of cloning itself. It extends the Light class, inheriting fundamental features for managing device on/off states. It also implements the CloneableDevice<Light> interface, which enforces a standard method called cloneDevice. This method allows creating exact copies of ClonableLight instances, enhancing the flexibility of device management and replication for scenarios requiring multiple identical light devices

## SmartHomeException
SmartHomeException is a custom exception class specifically designed for managing errors within the smart home system. It serves as an error-handling mechanism, allowing us to raise and catch exceptional situations that may occur during the operation of the smart home. This class is an essential tool for ensuring that the smart home system can gracefully handle and report errors, making the system more robust and user-friendly

## SmartHomeDevice (Generic Container for Smart Devices):
SmartHomeDevice is a class designed to function as a versatile container for storing and managing various types of smart devices. It employs the power of generics, enabling you to handle a diverse array of devices within a single structure. By providing a structured and flexible way to manage smart devices, this class significantly enhances the organization and management of the smart home system, making it adaptable to different types of devices and promoting code reusability.

## SmartHome (Main Class for Smart Home System)
SmartHome is the primary class serving as the central entry point for the smart home system. It orchestrates the functionality of the entire system. Within this class, you can create instances of diverse smart devices, such as lights and thermostats. These devices are added to the SmartHomeDevice, which acts as a central repository for managing them.

Furthermore, the SmartHome class leverages multithreading to simulate concurrent control of these devices, allowing them to operate simultaneously. This class is the heart of the smart home system, responsible for coordinating device interactions and providing a cohesive user experience.

## Key highlights of the project


Smart Device Hierarchy: We established a clear hierarchy of smart devices, from the base Device class to more specialized devices like Light and Thermostat. This hierarchy allows for efficient code reuse and easy extension of device capabilities.

Interface Implementation: The use of interfaces, such as SmartDevice and CloneableDevice, ensures a standardized set of methods and behaviors across different device types. This promotes consistency in device management and control.

Custom Exception Handling: The introduction of the SmartHomeException class provides a structured approach to error handling within the smart home system. It enables the graceful management of exceptional scenarios.

Generic Programming: The SmartHomeDevice class leverages generics to handle various types of smart devices in a single container. This promotes code flexibility and reusability.

Multithreading: The implementation of multithreading using the ExecutorService demonstrates the ability to manage multiple devices concurrently. This is crucial for real-world smart home scenarios where multiple devices may operate simultaneously.

Cloning Capability: The ClonableLight class showcases the concept of device cloning, allowing the creation of exact duplicates of specific devices. This feature is valuable for scenarios requiring multiple identical devices.


## Conclusion
In this smart home automation project, we've successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive system that showcases key principles of object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and more. The project provides a flexible and extensible framework for managing a variety of smart devices within a home environment.
